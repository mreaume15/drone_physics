Smart Targeting is a Python-based project that utilizes OpenCV to assist with targeting for drone payload drops.
The project provides a live camera feed with a crosshair overlay and displays 
real-time speed, 
altitude, 
drop time,
and distance data.

## Features

- Live camera feed with crosshair overlay
- Real-time display of speed, altitude, drop time, and distance
- Simulated sensor data for testing without hardware
- Manual drop mechanism simulation
